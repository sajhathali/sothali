          Our Mission
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          We believe no one should sleep hungry when surplus food is available around us. Our mission is to build a bridge between those who have extra food and those who need it the most â€” NGOs, Ashrams, and communities working to fight hunger.
